abstract="One of the major advantages of modular architectures in robotic systems is the ability to add or replace nodes, without needing to rearrange the whole system. In this type of system, autonomous agents can aid in the decision making and high-level control of the robot. For example, a robot may have a module for each of the effectors and sensors that it has and an agent with a plan library containing high-level plans to aid in the decision making within these modules. However, when autonomously replacing a node it can be difficult to reconfigure plans in the agent's plan library while retaining correctness. In this paper, we exploit the formal concept of capabilities in Belief-Desire-Intention agents and describe how agents can reason about these capabilities in order to reconfigure their plan library while retaining overall correctness constraints. To validate our approach, we show the implementation of our framework and an experiment using a practical example in the Mars rover scenario.",

abstract="The Multi-Agent Programming Contest in 2018 expanded upon the Agents in the City scenario used in the 2016 and 2017 editions of the contest. In this scenario two teams compete to score points by building and attacking wells using realistic city maps from OpenStreetMap. Wells are the main addition to the new version of the scenario; they cost money to build and generate score overtime but can be dismantled by agents from the other team. This, along with other additions, made it a significantly more complex scenario than before. In this paper, we describe the strategies used by our team, highlighting our adaptations and new additions from our participation in the previous years. We have fully explored the use of all three programming dimensions (agent, environment, and organisation) available in JaCaMo, the multi-agent system development platform that we used to implement our team. Our agents were able to dynamically switch between organisational roles, allowing them to promptly respond to changes in the environment and different opponent strategies. We were the highest-scoring team in the contest and our multi-agent system turned out to be stable and robust in solving the difficult problems posed by the contest scenario.",

abstract="Autonomy has been one of the most desirable features for robotic applications in recent years. This is evidenced by a recent surge of research in autonomous driving cars, strong government funding for research in robotics for extreme environments, and overall progress in service robots. Autonomous decision-making is often at the core of these systems, thus, it is important to be able to verify and validate properties that relate to the correct behaviour that is expected of the system. Our main contribution in this paper, is an interface for integrating BDI-based agents into robotic systems developed using ROS. We use the Gwendolen language to program our BDI agents and to make use of the AJPF model checker in order to verify properties related to the decision-making in the agent programs. Our case studies include 3D simulations using a simple autonomous patrolling behaviour of a TurtleBot, and multiple TurtleBots servicing a house that can cooperate with each other in case of failure.",

abstract="The Curiosity rover is one of the most complex systems successfully deployed in a planetary exploration mission to date. It was sent by NASA to explore the surface of Mars and to identify potential signs of life. Even though it has limited autonomy on-board, most of its decisions are made by the ground control team. This hinders the speed at which the Curiosity reacts to its environment, due to the communication delays between Earth and Mars. Depending on the orbital position of both planets, it can take 4--24 min for a message to be transmitted between Earth and Mars. If the Curiosity were controlled autonomously, it would be able to perform its activities much faster and more flexibly. However, one of the major barriers to increased use of autonomy in such scenarios is the lack of assurances that the autonomous behaviour will work as expected. In this paper, we use a Robot Operating System (ROS) model of the Curiosity that is simulated in Gazebo and add an autonomous agent that is responsible for high-level decision-making. Then, we use a mixture of formal and non-formal techniques to verify the distinct system components (ROS nodes). This use of heterogeneous verification techniques is essential to provide guarantees about the nodes at different abstraction levels, and allows us to bring together relevant verification evidence to provide overall assurance.",

	abstract = {When applying formal verification to a system that interacts with the real world, we must use a model of the environment. This model represents an abstraction of the actual environment, so it is necessarily incomplete and hence presents an issue for system verification. If the actual environment matches the model, then the verification is correct; however, if the environment falls outside the abstraction captured by the model, then we cannot guarantee that the system is well behaved. A solution to this problem consists in exploiting the model of the environment used for statically verifying the system’s behaviour and, if the verification succeeds, using it also for validating the model against the real environment via runtime verification. The article discusses this approach and demonstrates its feasibility by presenting its implementation on top of a framework integrating the Agent Java PathFinder model checker. A high-level Domain Specific Language is used to model the environment in a user-friendly way; the latter is then compiled to trace expressions for both static formal verification and runtime verification. To evaluate our approach, we apply it to two different case studies: an autonomous cruise control system and a simulation of the Mars Curiosity rover.},

Being able to send a robot, rather than a human, into a nuclear facility or deep space is very appealing. However, building these robotic systems is just the start and we still need to carry out a range of verification and validation tasks to ensure that the systems to be deployed are as safe and reliable as possible. Based on our experience across three research and innovation hubs within the UK’s “Robots for a Safer World” programme, we present an overview of the relevant techniques and challenges in this area. As the hubs are active across nuclear, offshore, and space environments, this gives a breadth of issues common to many inspection robots.},

The First Workshop on Agents and Robots for reliable Engineered Autonomy (AREA), organised the first time in 2020, aims at encouraging cross-disciplinary collaborations and exchange of ideas among researchers working in these research areas. This paper presents a perspective of the organisers that aims at highlighting the latest research trends, future directions, challenges, and open problems. It also includes feedback from the discussions held during the AREA workshop. The goal of this perspective is to provide a high-level view of current research trends for researchers that aim at working in the intersection of these research areas.},
