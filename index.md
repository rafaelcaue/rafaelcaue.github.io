I am part of the Autonomy and Verification Network, where I work in a grant supported by the Royal Academy of Engineering under the Chairs in Emerging Technologies scheme. Previously, I was a Research Associate at the University of Liverpool from 2018 to 2020 where I worked in the research hubs RAIN and FAIR-SPACE. I obtained my Master and my Doctorate degrees in Computer Science from PUCRS (2014 and 2018 resp.), and Bachelor degree in Computer Science from Centro Universit√°rio Franciscano (2012).
