# Short Bio

> I am a [Lecturer](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/rafael.cardoso){:target="\_blank"} in the Department of Computing Science at the [University of Aberdeen](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"} (UK), and a member of the [Agents at Aberdeen](https://agentsataberdeen.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} (A<sup>3</sup>). I am also Honorary Research Associate at both the University of Liverpool (UK) and the University of Manchester (UK), and I am part of the [Autonomy and Verification Network](https://autonomy-and-verification.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}. I obtained my Master and my Doctorate degrees in Computer Science from PUCRS (2014 and 2018 resp.), and Bachelor degree in Computer Science from Centro Universit√°rio Franciscano (2012). My main research themes include cross-cutting research on multi-agent systems and multi-agent planning, as well as integrating formal verification in software development. I serve as a member of the program committee in several international conferences such as AAAI, IJCAI, AAMAS, and ECAI.
