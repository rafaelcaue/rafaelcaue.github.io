<p style="margin-top: -10px;"> **Abstract:** With the success of artificial intelligence in recent years, reinforcement learning (RL), a subfield of machine learning, has attracted great attention in recent years. Reinforcement learning also plays an important role in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS), such as autonomous driving, senor networks and games. In this talk, we will start with general information of reinforcement learning. Then, I will concentrate on the possible uses of RL in the development of interactive and learnable autonomous agents, both in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. We will also explore the connections between RL and engineering multi-agent systems in future research.

Bio: Dr. Shihan Wang is a tenured assistant professor at Utrecht University, Intelligent systems group. She received her Ph.D. from Tokyo Institute of Technology and worked as a postdoctoral researcher at machine learning lab of University of Amsterdam. She was also a visiting researcher at Computational Social Science Lab of ETH Zurich. With a knowledge portfolio of machine learning, her current research focuses on developing efficient, scalable and reliable reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for intelligent and interactive systems. Her technical interest covers both single-agent and multi-agent RL, and their practical usage in sequential decision-making tasks. Several practical domains are especially interesting for her, including but not limited to dialogue, personalized healthcare, energy optimization and autonomous driving.

### <a id="talk2"></a> **Sebastian Rodriguez: Agile Approach for Agent Oriented Software Engineering**

(Chair: TBA)

<img src="assets/images/sebastian.jpg" alt="Sebastian Rodriguez" style="max-width: 150px; float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">

<p style="margin-top: -10px;"> <b>Abstract:</b> The agile software development life cycle is widely used in industry today due to its highly flexible and iterative processes that facilitate rapid prototyping. In this talk, we advocate to close the gap between mainstream software engineering and agent technology by adopting and adapting well-known and accepted techniques. We introduce an agile approach to capturing requirements in agent systems via user and system stories and how to translate these requirements into goal-oriented agent models. We cover how to define test cases to verify the expected system behaviour following a Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) approach. We leverage a range of state-of-the-art development tools, inheriting the rich set of features they provide. Finally, we discuss future directions and opportunities. </p>
