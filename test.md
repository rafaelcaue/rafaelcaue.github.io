<p style="margin-top: -10px;"> **Abstract:** With the success of artificial intelligence in recent years, reinforcement learning (RL), a subfield of machine learning, has attracted great attention in recent years. Reinforcement learning also plays an important role in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS), such as autonomous driving, senor networks and games. In this talk, we will start with general information of reinforcement learning. Then, I will concentrate on the possible uses of RL in the development of interactive and learnable autonomous agents, both in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. We will also explore the connections between RL and engineering multi-agent systems in future research.

Bio: Dr. Shihan Wang is a tenured assistant professor at Utrecht University, Intelligent systems group. She received her Ph.D. from Tokyo Institute of Technology and worked as a postdoctoral researcher at machine learning lab of University of Amsterdam. She was also a visiting researcher at Computational Social Science Lab of ETH Zurich. With a knowledge portfolio of machine learning, her current research focuses on developing efficient, scalable and reliable reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for intelligent and interactive systems. Her technical interest covers both single-agent and multi-agent RL, and their practical usage in sequential decision-making tasks. Several practical domains are especially interesting for her, including but not limited to dialogue, personalized healthcare, energy optimization and autonomous driving.
